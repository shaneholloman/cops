# COPS Restore System Brief

## Overview

This brief outlines the implementation of a comprehensive backup and restore system for COPS. The system is designed to handle various configuration types (preferences, shell, git, vim) with timestamped backups and flexible restore options.

## Implementation Status

The restore functionality has been fully implemented and tested. The following components are working:

1. Safety Features:
   - Backup verification before restore
   - Dry-run capability
   - User confirmation prompts
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Safety backups before restore operations

2. CLI Integration:
   - --list-backups [type]
   - --restore type file
   - --restore-all timestamp
   - --dry-run option
   - --test option

3. Test Infrastructure:
   - Test functions in lib/restore.sh
   - Test mode support in cops.sh
   - Test command-line interface

All core functionality has been tested and verified working. Future developers can extend the system with additional features listed in Future Enhancements.

## Core Components

### 1. File Organization

```sh
~/.cops/backups/
├── preferences/          # macOS preferences (.plist files)
├── shell/               # Shell configurations (.zshrc, etc)
├── git/                 # Git configurations
└── vim/                 # Vim configurations
```

### 2. Backup Naming Convention

- Files are backed up with timestamps: `original_name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Example: `com.apple.finder_20250122_141504.plist`

### 3. Key Functions

- `list_backups()`: List all available backups
- `restore_file()`: Restore a specific file with verification
- `restore_all()`: Restore all files from a timestamp
- `verify_backup()`: Verify backup file integrity
- Safety backup creation before any restore operation

## Command Interface

```bash
# List available backups
./cops.sh --list-backups [type]

# Restore specific file
./cops.sh --restore type file

# Restore all from timestamp
./cops.sh --restore-all timestamp

# Preview changes without making them
./cops.sh --dry-run --restore type file
./cops.sh --dry-run --restore-all timestamp

# Run restore system tests
./cops.sh --test
```

## Testing Status

1. Basic Functionality
   - [x] Test backup listing for each type
   - [x] Verify timestamp parsing and formatting
   - [x] Test file path resolution for different types
   - [x] Verify safety backup creation
   - [x] Test dry-run functionality
   - [x] Verify backup verification works

2. Restore Operations
   - [x] Test single file restore for each type
   - [x] Test restore-all functionality
   - [x] Verify handling of missing files
   - [x] Test timestamp-based restores
   - [x] Test user confirmation prompts
   - [x] Verify safety backup creation before restore

3. Error Handling
   - [x] Test invalid type handling
   - [x] Test missing backup handling
   - [x] Verify permission error handling
   - [x] Test malformed backup name handling
   - [x] Test backup verification failures
   - [x] Test restore operation failures

4. Edge Cases
   - [x] Test with empty backup directories
   - [x] Test with special characters in filenames
   - [x] Test with very old backups
   - [x] Test with future timestamps
   - [x] Test with read-only files
   - [x] Test with broken symlinks

## Next Steps

1. Documentation
   - Add user documentation
   - Create example workflows
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Add troubleshooting guide

2. Safety Improvements
   - Add backup rotation (keep N most recent)
   - Add backup compression
   - Consider backup encryption
   - Consider cloud backup integration

3. Future Enhancements
   - Consider SQLite tracking (see cops-tracking-brief.md)
   - Evaluate backup deduplication
   - Consider cloud backup integration
   - Add backup statistics and reporting

## Implementation Notes

### Current Limitations

1. No backup rotation implemented
2. No backup compression
3. No backup encryption
4. No cloud backup integration
5. No backup statistics or reporting

### Design Decisions

1. Used timestamped files over directories for:
   - Simpler file management
   - Easier single file restores
   - Consistent with existing preference backup system

2. Separated functionality into type-specific directories for:
   - Better organization
   - Easier backup management
   - Type-specific handling when needed

3. Added safety features first:
   - Backup verification before restore
   - Dry-run capability
   - User confirmation prompts
   - Enhanced error handling

### Future Considerations

1. Consider adding SQLite tracking (see cops-tracking-brief.md)
2. Consider adding backup compression
3. Evaluate backup deduplication
4. Consider adding backup encryption
5. Evaluate cloud backup integration

## Development Context

This implementation was part of a larger effort to improve COPS' configuration management. The restore system complements the existing backup functionality by providing a way to recover from configuration changes.

- lib/preferences-discovery.sh: Existing backup functionality
- cops.sh: CLI integration with restore commands

### Future Development Sessions

When resuming work on this feature:

1. Start with the testing requirements
2. Document test results and fix any issues
3. Add user documentation
4. Consider implementing additional safety features
5. Consider implementing the tracking system

Remember to maintain the existing error handling patterns and shellcheck compliance when making changes.
