# `.cops`

(Config OPeratorS)

A modern, safe, and structured approach to macOS configuration management.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Works, but not complete yet!
>"cops" implements opinionated configuration choices and represents an initial foundation.
>
>Its' a modern replacement for the somewhat long-in-the-tooth dotfiles framework. For a complete overview of planned enhancements and additional features, please refer to the blueprint. Please share your opinions and suggestions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install your configuration
git clone https://github.com/shaneholloman/cops.git ~/.cops
cd ~/.cops
code config.yaml  # Review and customize settings
./bootstrap.sh # gets the system ready for cops if it's a brand new machine - not sure yet if I'll roll this into the setup script or not...
./cops.sh # Apply your configuration
```

Your configuration is now:

- Set up in ~/.cops
- In a fresh git repository
- Ready for customization
- Safe to experiment with

## Overview

This repository provides multiple safeguards for risk-free testing and deployment:

  - Develop from any directory while targeting ~/.cops
  - Run risk free testing in directly in GitHub workflows
  - Verify idempotency through repeated test runs
  - Use Time Machine snapshots for instant rollbacks
  - Test changes in isolation from your active configuration

A modular "cops" management system for macOS that automates the setup of development environments through a centralized YAML configuration. The system emphasizes safety, reversibility, and maintainability through master switches and comprehensive backup capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Safe by Design**
  - APFS snapshots for rollback
  - Master switches for control
  - Validation before changes
  - Backup of existing configs

- **Simple but Powerful**
  - Single config.yaml
  - No external dependencies
  - Homebrew integration
  - Modern tooling support

- **Structured Approach**
  - Organized configuration
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Consistent directory layout
  - Easy to maintain

## Working with `.cops`

### Installation Location

```sh
~/.cops)
```

Your active configuration lives in ~/.cops:

- Personal settings in config.yaml
- Custom tool configurations
- Shell preferences and aliases
- Fresh git repo for tracking changes

```bash
# Track your changes
cd ~/.cops
git add .
git commit -m "Updated my configuration"

# Optional: Backup to your own repository
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Custom Configuration Files

You can use different configuration files for different purposes:

```bash
# Use a specific config file
./cops.sh --config-file configs/desktop.yaml

# Works with both .yaml and .yml extensions
./cops.sh --config-file configs/server.yml

# Auto-detects extension if not specified (not best practice though)
./cops.sh --config-file configs/department
```

This enables:

- Different configurations for different machines (desktop, server, testing or whatever)
- Department-specific configurations
- Test configurations for development
- Special-case configurations for specific use cases

The default config.yaml is used if no custom config file is specified.

### Development Location (optional)

You can also run cops from a different location:

```bash
# Clone to any directory for testing
git clone https://github.com/shaneholloman/cops.git ~/projects/cops
cd ~/projects/cops
./bootstrap.sh  # Optional: Prep yer system if it doesn't have brew, yt and gettext yet
./cops.sh  # Updates ~/.cops
```

This allows you to:

- Test changes before applying
- Maintain a development copy
- Still update ~/.cops consistently
